Notes

- IMPORTANT: the sprites for the pieces are NOT tied to the objects yet. They need to be.
- Need to get server set up soon
- A turn will go as follows:
 - Before the game, generate the moves for white.
 - Player moves.
 - If the king is captured, end the game and return a flag.
 - Next player's moves are generated BEFORE the next turn starts. This allows to check for checkmate.
 - If the king is checkmated, end the game and return a flag.
 - Turn end. Next player's turn.

- At any time, if a player's clock hits 0, end the game and return a flag.
- Maybe find a way to process moves locally?

- Pawn promotion
- Drops
