Notes

- Checkmate
 - At the start of turn, ALL pieces will call getMoves()
 - All these moves will be pushed to a master list
 - A move array will have its owner in it
 - Make a copy of the board. Screw memory usage.
 - Execute all possible moves and check for king check
 - If there are no safe moves, it is checkmate.
 - ONLY contact and knight check are mate
